# addition-game
A fun math game for kids of all ages and adults! Test your addition skills while you have fun playing against time.

This web application is built using React with a number of packages including Material UI, jQuery, and react-router-dom. The app development makes extensive use of hooks including useState, useEffect, and useNavigate to provide the needed functionality and responsiveness.

To start, a player selects a difficulty level and based on their choice, the scoring system is updated. Hence, by choosing a level like difficulty, a player scores higher with each correct answer. Each game has a 60s countdown timer after which the app rereoutes to a new component to display the player's score and a remark based on their performance.
